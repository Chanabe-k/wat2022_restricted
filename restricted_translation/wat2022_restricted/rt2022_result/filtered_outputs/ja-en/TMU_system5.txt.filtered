The basic disease state of bronchial asthma is chronic airway inflammation.
Many cells such as eosinophils, T-cells, mast cells, neutrophils, macrophages and airway epithelium and various liquid factors are involved in the airway inflammation.
It is taken seriously that the Th2 cytokine is concerned in not only central airway but also peripheral airway on the position of the airway inflammation.
The disease states of airway remodeling and turning into embryonic cell of tracheal epithelial cell, basal membrane thickening, hyperplasia and angiogenesis of tracheal smooth muscle cause irreversible airway closure and promote airway anaphylaxia and asthma chronically.
For the treatment of asthma, it is important to introduce antiinflammatory drugs mainly on inhalation steroids from the early stage in order to suppress the remodeling of the airway in addition to the control of allergic inflammation.
The bronchial asthma is characterized by repeated paroxysmal stridor, dyspnea and cough, which are easy to appear in the night and early morning, and in the auscultation finding, it is the continuous whistle sound, especially the harmonic flute-like sound.
In addition, the objective evaluation of the air flow restriction by the respiratory function test is necessary for the diagnosis of the asthma.
It is evaluated by spirometry and peak flow meter, and the airway hypersensitivity test is carried out.
The evaluation of the airway inflammation is carried out by sputum test, nitrogen monoxide concentration in the expiration, expiration condensate measurement, and allergological examination.
The diseases which cause stridor and dyspnea of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, insufficiency of left heart and hyperventilation syndrome are the differentiation.
In clinical diagnosis, the symptom of air flow restriction occurred paroxysmally and repeatedly, partial reversibility of air flow restriction and other diseases.
As a result of our genetic analysis, the possibility in which the IL-17F gene fulfiled the important role in the disease state of the asthma was guessed.
PAI-1 may be deeply involved in the formation of the remodeling of the airway, and the functional polymorphism of the PAI-1 gene seems to be one of the genetic factors which regulate whether the remodeling of the airway is easy to progress.
CCL5 is the chemokine strongly induced from airway epithelium in viral infection, and acquisition chronic airway inflammation in high-age asthma.
It was guessed that the natural immune system was deeply concerned in the disease state of the allergy, when the role of the macrophage inhibitory factor was noticed.
