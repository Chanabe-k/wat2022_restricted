The basic disease state of bronchial asthma is chronic airway inflammation.

It is emphasized that the Th2 cytokine is concerned in not only central airway but also peripheral airway for the position of the airway inflammation.

It is important for the treatment of asthma to introduce antiinflammatory drugs mainly on inhalation steroids from the early stage in order to suppress the remodeling of airway in addition to the control of allergic inflammation.

In addition, the objective evaluation of the air flow restriction by the respiratory function test is necessary for the diagnosis of the asthma.
It is evaluated by spirometry and peak flow meter, and the airway hypersensitivity test is carried out.


It is important in the clinical diagnosis that 1) the symptom which derives from the air flow restriction occurs paroxysmally and repeatedly, 2) there is at least the partial reversibility in the air flow restriction, 3) other diseases are excluded.
As a result of our genetic analysis, the possibility in which the IL-17F gene fulfiled the important role in the disease state of the asthma was guessed.
The PAI-1 may be deeply involved in the formation of the remodeling of the airway, and the functional polymorphism of the PAI-1 gene seems to be one of the genetic factors which regulate-ness to progress the remodeling of the airway.

It was guessed that the natural immune system was deeply concerned in the disease state of the allergy, when the role of the macrophage inhibitory factor was noticed.
The understanding of the disease deepened from them by clarifying the pathophysiological and common pathway at the molecular level.
By making these routes to be a target, it wants to expect that it contributes to the advance on prevention and treatment of asthma.

It is important to acquire the patient by himself, because there are small specially difficult points in the adjustment.
It is also recommended to pile the experiences by utilizing the time of the exhibition of machine manufacturers.

The fuel cells are expected as a new power generation system which can simultaneously solve sustainable growth of the economy, stable supply of the energy, and environmental preservation.
The research and development of alkali and phosphate types has been finished.
The molten carbonate type has reached a stage to promote the development of a 1,000kW class power generation system.
In major detergent manufacturers in Japan, used surfactants have been converted from anionic LAS to nonionic POER.
However, there is a problem that the lethal toxicity for freshwater fish is comparatively strong in POER.
Therefore, for the purpose of reducing the lethal toxicity of POER mixed detergent, the lethal toxicity experiment of Oryzias latipes was tried under the condition close to actual washing.
As the result, it was possible to weaken the ichthyotoxicity without lowering the detergency, if POER and anionic AS were quantitatively well balanced.

The ceramics for high frequency insulation and the evaluation were described as the titled ceramics.
The alumina, steatite, and forsterite were evaluated, and the result of the loss reduction research carried out in the Fine Ceramic Center was reported.
This paper introduces the electrical evaluation of high frequency insulation ceramics and the dielectric resonator which can measure low dielectric loss in the microwave band.


This paper explains the features and prospects of the titled magnets noticed as post-Nd magnets.
The adsorption reaction of N atoms in Sm2Fe17 was outlined, and it was shown that the characteristics changed by the method of the nitriding.
Since Sm2Fe17N3 decomposes above about 550 °C, the sintering preparation method can not be applied, and the application as bond magnets is promising.
This paper shows the development situation of Sm2Fe17N3 magnets in each research institute.
This paper introduces the application of this magnet to high magnetic properties and high heat resistance.

The energy release rate was measured by AE measurement under tensile loading to plate specimens of 100 〜 300rpm rotation speed and 0 〜 2.5mm hole radius.
As the rotational speed increases, the fiber breaks, and the energy release rate decreases.
The smaller the hole diameter, the smaller the breaking load and the larger the energy release rate.
Effects of short‐chain fatty acids on intestinal functions are explained.



Poly loft fibers (polyester fibers) can be alkaline processed for weight reduction faster than conventional polyester fibers.
On the assumption of blend knit fabrics of polyloft and rayon, the weight loss processing of polyloft and rayon fabrics in the same bath was carried out in sodium hydroxide solution.

When weight reduction promoters were added, the weight reduction rate of polyloft increased a little, but the weight reduction rate of rayon became almost zero.
The establishment of the weight reduction processing conditions is necessary in order to carry out the weight reduction processing so that the strength of the rayon may be kept to some extent.
The antibacterial and deodorization properties are required in order to realize the comfortable life.
The development of the fibers with the skin care function advances for the stimulation sensitive skin.
This paper introduces antibacterial and deodorization nautral fibers \"Chitopoly\" which are effective for atopic dermatitis.
Chitosan contained in this is a polysaccharide got from Crustacean and insects, and it is approximated to cellulose.
Chitopoly is a product mixed with chitosan in polynosic, and has the following features: 1) antibacterial and deodorization functions, 2) biodegradability, and 3) effects on allergic symptoms.
The ceramic is made into the antimicrobial by adding the inorganic antimicrobial agent which is stable even in high temperature to the glassy layer (coating agent) which is coated on the substrate.

And, the effect of the antimicrobe treated article for generation prevention of the toilet urine scale fouling and generation prevention of the fouling (slime) was explained.
The problem for more effectively demonstrating the antimicrobial function was also described.



In the future, not only the case of other position is added, but also the examination on the skeletal structure and the movable range for making the clothing design easy to move and comfortable is carried out, and it wants to expand the database construction.
This paper explains the circumstances in which OSAKA GAS tackled the Internet.
The intranet which utilizes the mechanism of the Internet as it is is is optimum for the system mainly on the information reading.
This paper explains the merit and demerit of Intranet.

The construction of total business support system using Intranet is promoted.
In addition, this paper reports that various technological development programs are advanced in order to construct convenient applications.


However, the observation of the plate was not possible from the viewpoint of the laterality, and information such as the thickness was not obtained.
Light ‐ field and dark ‐ field images were taken at moderate magnifications of several tens of thousands times, and many fine particles adhered on the sample surface and uniform thickness interference fringes corresponding to the change of the sample thickness were observed.
The lattice images were not obtained in the high resolutin power image observation.
On II, the same observation as I was also carried out.
This paper examines the reason why full color electrophotographic images are inferior to printed images in terms of picture quality.
The difference between the two images was considered to be caused by the micro‐structure of the thickness direction of the images.

As the result, it was proven that the thickness of the image was little for the printed image and that the uniformity is high.
The control of the thickness direction seems to be effective for upgrading of the image quality of the electro photography image.
